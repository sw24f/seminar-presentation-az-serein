# What is UT-GLOBUS?

## UT-GLOBUS

University of Texas - GLObal Building heights for Urban Studies (UT-GLOBUS).

- **Introduction to UT-GLOBUS:**
    - UT-GLOBUS combines **Tabular data**(spaceborne elevation, population density and polygon area) and **LiDAR** with **Random Forest Regression** to estimate building-level information.

    - UT-GLOBUS is a dataset developed to provide detailed **Building Heights** and **Urban Canopy Parameters (UCPs)** for over 1,200 cities around the world.


# How to develop UT-GLOBUS

## Data Acquisition and Processing

- **Urban Block Datasets:** Acquired diverse building sizes (high, mid, low-rise) for model generalization.
- **LiDAR Data:** Light Detection and Ranging.
- **Spaceborne Elevation Data:** Combined ICESat-2, GEDI, ALOS DSM and WSF 3-D datasets to address spatial gaps and urban sprawl.
- **Population Density:** High correlation between population density and building Heights.
- **2-D Building Footprints:** Utilized OSM, Google and Microsoft footprints, with deep learning for areas lacking coverage.

## Development Process

## Random Forest Regression

- **Key Attributes:**
    - Ground Truth:  LiDAR-based nDSM building height used as the target variable.
    - Spaceborne AGL Height: Spaceborne nDSM from WSF 3-D assigned to building footprints.
    - Population Density: Average population density, used to capture population number.
    - Polygon Area: Spatial extent of each building footprint.

## Training Details

- **Dataset:** 268,000 buildings from 6 US cities (NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, LA, SF).
- **Training Split:** 80% for training, 20% for validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** 240 estimators, max depth = 50, min samples to split = 12, 3-fold cross-validation. Bootstrap sampling enabled, features per split = sqrt(total features).

## Validation Output 1(Building Heights)

## Validation 1 Summary

- **Model Performance:**
    - Validation dataset: R² = 0.76, RMSE = 5.4 meters, indicating good fit but with some underestimation (MBE = -0.06m).
    - Testing dataset: R² = 0.69, RMSE = 9.1 meters, showing reduced accuracy with a slight overestimation (MBE = 0.10m).

- **Resicual Analysis:**
    - Errors increase for taller buildings (especially above 30 meters), with higher variation in predictions.

## Validation Output 2(UCPs)

## Validation Output 2 Summary

- **UCPs Validation Output Comparison:**
    - UT-GLOBUS : Achieved a high R² of 0.84, showing strong alignment with LiDAR heights.
    - Li et al. (2020): Had a lower R² of 0.41, highlighting less accuracy compared to UT-GLOBUS.


# Where to use UT-GLOBUS?
